# Hello, Visitor!

**I develop and design online experiences for brands** 
through web design and development backed up with years of experience through my education and work.

## Who Am I?
I'm a UI designer with a passion for front-end development, I drink too much coffee, and I'm always trying to learn something!
Next to my day-job for which I'm active 4 days a week, I'm currently studying for my BA in Communication and Multimedia Design
